## Nightlife Coordination App
<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
[this](http://whatsgoinontonight.herokuapp.com).
 Then deploy it to Glitch.<br>
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch 
project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit 
[this](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects).<br>
<br>
Here are the specific <b><i>user stories</i></b> you should implement for this project:
<br>
 - As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
 - As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
 - As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
 - As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
<br><br>
<b><i>Hint:</i></b> Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. 
If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
